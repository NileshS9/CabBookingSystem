problems in project
1.so when i was booking a ride in project i have to created two driver and user after ,
the frist driver was ravi with currentLocation wadgaon and second drvier was ravindra with 
currentLocation kothurd. after that i created a user rahul whos currentlocation was kothurd . 
so the main problem was both driver were available. so after booking the ride the driver
assigned was ravi who was in wadgoan. so if the driver ravindra is in same place in 
kothrud where user rahul is present the system assigned the driver who is in different place .
so as per logic the driver with same location shouldd be assigned to user who is near with 
ravindra.
